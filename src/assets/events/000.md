The colony of Evergreen, close to your flight path, has issued a distress call. Your detachment has been outed to go and assist the colonists against as-yet-unknown assailants. According to your CO, these orders come down from the system-local Union administrator. As much as it’s a pain in the ass, you’ve got to respond; law of the void, though unofficial, says no spacer can let a distress call gounanswered. You don’t know much about the colony world – “Hercynia”, some relic of the Second Committee’s empire-building project – but it must be important if Union wants mech pilots to get involved.
