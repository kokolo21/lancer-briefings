Speaker: Cmdr. Orlan “Ashglass” Venn

Alright, listen up, rookies.

You’ve signed the papers, got your callsigns, and now you’re Mirrorsmoke. Congratulations—or condolences, depending on who you ask. Either way, you’re in it now.

Out there, no one cares how shiny your frame is or what your academy score was. They care if you finish the job and make it back in one piece. We’ve built our name on that simple truth.

You’ll hear plenty of stories about this company—some true, most not. Doesn’t matter. What matters is that when the smoke clears, someone’s still standing in our colors.

You’ll get bad intel, worse pay, and the kind of missions that don’t make the news feeds. But you’ll also get to pilot for real, and you’ll have a crew that’ll drag your busted chassis out of the fire if it comes to it.

That’s Mirrorsmoke. We don’t shine, we burn slow and steady. Welcome aboard, Lancers. Don’t make me regret it.
