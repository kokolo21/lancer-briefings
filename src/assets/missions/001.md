## Bug Hunt

*HUDSON: “Is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug-hunt?”*

*GORMAN: “All we know is that there is still no contact with the colony, and that a xenomorph may be involved.”*

*FROST: “Excuse me sir, a what?”*

*GORMAN: “A xenomorph.”*

*HICKS (louder): “It’s a bug-hunt.”*

# Choosing a Task
Option 1 - Before Evergreen’s landing bowl can be fully drained and refitted with essential infrastructure, Chief Engineer Fielding must complete a series of delicate and technically demanding repairs. These upgrades are vital — once completed, they will enable larger offworld vessels to make direct landfall, reducing our reliance on costly shuttle operations.
Your assignment would be to accompany Fielding and his engineering team into the bowl and ensure their safety while they work. The area remains unstable and potentially hostile. Your presence would guarantee the project’s success and, in turn, strengthen Evergreen’s logistical lifelines.

Option 2 - Alternatively, we face a more immediate danger. A sniper — elusive, disciplined, and clearly well-equipped — has been terrorizing our perimeter and harassing militia movements for weeks. Neutralizing this threat would bring much-needed relief to our security forces, allowing them to reposition and stabilize Evergreen’s defenses.

Time is critical and you will only be able to help with one of these tasks.

# Stakes

If you are unable to help us, we will be forced into more desperate measures and will be heavily impacted. Evergreen will struggle for the next few months... But we will recover. Evergreen depends on you Lancers. Don't fail us.

> "Two months ago, a sniper set up position in the forest hills surrounding Evergreen... We haven't been able to fight back as they clearly have superior firepower and it's mere presence has inspired terror in the colonists. Meanwhile, Fielding's repairs on the bowl are crucial for us to receive more frequent shipments and to lower the costs of those shipments. Makes the colony safer by allowing the bigger ships to land, instead of just hovering and being easy targets." - Brava Hadura
