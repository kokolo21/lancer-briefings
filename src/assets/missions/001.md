## Landfall

*“Life is full of surprises, some good, some not so good...”*  

Alright, Task Forces Seven and Thirteen, listen up. You’ve probably seen the ping on the boards already. Here’s the full story.

Three months back, comms went dead from a place called Tamastea-5. Tiny lab colony, middle of nowhere, not on any official registry. Which means the Union’s not touching it.

A private client—corporate, deep pockets, wants us to check it out. Seems they had some kind of stake there. Our fleet was closest, and you know how this works: nearest guns get the job.

Orbital scans show total power loss. No beacon, no life signatures, no automated systems. Place is cold as a coffin but it appears much larger than what the dossier suggested.

Objectives are simple:

• Investigate the colony. Find out what happened.
• Recover survivors, if any.
• Secure their research data — client says it’s “vital.” Don’t ask.
• Restore colony power to enable data uplink and evac support.

Task Force Seven, you’re on point—drop to the main facility, secure the site, and clear any hazards.

Task Force Thirteen, you'll handle the grid, get power running and comms live.

Expect system damage, environmental rot, and maybe worse. If it’s been three months, whatever happened down there had time to settle in.
 …That’s all. Prep your frames and stand by for deployment.

# Goals

- Eliminate any Autonomous Security Forces in the area.
- Locate the power facility and turn it back on.
- Find if there are any survivors in the power facility.

# Stakes

- Entry into the main facility
- Recovery of critical data

> Three months ago, all communications with the Tamastea-5 laboratory colony ceased.
The Union has declined involvement due to the colony’s remoteness and unregistered status. However, a corporate stakeholder—whose name isn’t important to you—has contracted Mirrorsmoke to investigate the situation. It took us two weeks to get here due to a lack of a blink-gate but we got here. I hope
